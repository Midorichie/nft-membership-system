# NFT Membership System

A decentralized membership system built on Stacks blockchain that uses NFTs for access control to exclusive content and events.

## Overview

This smart contract system implements:
- NFT-based membership tokens
- Access control mechanisms
- Membership validation
- Event/content gating

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `nft-membership.clar`: Core NFT and membership logic
- `traits.clar`: Shared interfaces and traits

### Development Environment
- Clarity Language
- Clarinet Testing Framework
- TypeScript for tests

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install -g @stacks/cli
npm install -g clarinet
```

2. Initialize the project:
```bash
clarinet new
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations

- Access control validation
- NFT ownership verification
- Prevention of unauthorized transfers
- Rate limiting for mint operations

## Testing

Tests are written in TypeScript using Clarinet's testing framework. Minimum test coverage requirement: 50%
